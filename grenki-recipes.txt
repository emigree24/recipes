Grenkis are Russian for fried bread slices covered in egg. Kind of like french toast, minus the sweetness

Prepare your bread slices, beat together 2-3 eggs for number of slices that equal about half a loaf of bread. But really there is no right or wrong. The more egg you add the more you are splurging, so do it to your fancy.

on a large flat pan pour the beaten eggs and then place the slices of bread on it. Let it soak for a minute, if the bread is old, the harder the bread is, the longer you have to soak (you would need more eggs as well). Turn over to the other side, prepare the frying pan.

Heat the frying pan, pour a bit of olive or any type of oil you use to cook. Keep the temperature at medium. Once the frying pan is ready, place the bread slices. Wait until the side is golden brown before turning to the other side. 

Have a bit of patience and there you have your grenkis!
